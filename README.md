# Banana Leaf Disease Detection with CNNs

This project focuses on detecting diseases in banana leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khajabasha/banana-disease-dataset).

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains images of:
- **Healthy banana leaves**
- **Diseased banana leaves** (e.g., Black Sigatoka, Fusarium Wilt, etc.)

**Link to Dataset**: [Banana Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khajabasha/banana-disease-dataset)

## Key Features

- Preprocessing images (resizing, normalization)
- Building CNN models like ResNet and VGG
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy and F1 score

---

## Results

- Achieved high accuracy in detecting banana leaf diseases
- Can predict the disease type for new images

---

## Credits

- Dataset provided by [Khajabasha Shaik](https://www.kaggle.com/khajabasha).
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras.
